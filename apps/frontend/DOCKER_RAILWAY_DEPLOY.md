# üê≥ Railway Deployment with Custom Dockerfile

## Problem Solved

Railway was detecting the monorepo root structure and failing to build. This custom Dockerfile approach bypasses all auto-detection and gives us complete control over the build process.

## Files Created

‚úÖ **Dockerfile** - Multi-stage build for Next.js standalone output
‚úÖ **.dockerignore** - Excludes unnecessary files from Docker context
‚úÖ **railway.toml** - Forces Railway to use Dockerfile builder
‚úÖ **next.config.ts** - Updated with `output: 'standalone'`

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Link Railway Project

Since Railway CLI requires interactive mode, you have two options:

**Option A: Link existing project**
```bash
cd apps/frontend
railway link
# Select workspace: adi121193's Projects
# Select project: AP2-PaymentGetway (or create new)
# Select environment: production
```

**Option B: Create new project**
```bash
cd apps/frontend
railway init
# Enter project name: frameos-frontend
# This creates a new isolated project
```

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

```bash
railway variables set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.your-domain.com
railway variables set NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://frameos.railway.app
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
```

Or set via Railway Dashboard:
1. Go to your project
2. Click **Variables**
3. Add:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = `https://api.your-domain.com`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` = `https://your-app.railway.app`
   - `NODE_ENV` = `production`

### Step 3: Deploy

```bash
railway up
```

Railway will:
1. Detect `railway.toml` with `builder = "DOCKERFILE"`
2. Use the custom Dockerfile instead of Nixpacks
3. Build in 3 stages: deps ‚Üí builder ‚Üí runner
4. Deploy the standalone Next.js server

### Step 4: Verify

```bash
# Check deployment status
railway status

# View logs
railway logs

# Get deployment URL
railway open
```

## How the Dockerfile Works

### Stage 1: Dependencies
- Uses Node 20 Alpine (lightweight)
- Copies only package files
- Runs `npm ci` for reproducible installs

### Stage 2: Builder
- Copies dependencies from Stage 1
- Copies all source code
- Runs `npm run build` with `output: 'standalone'`
- Next.js creates optimized production build

### Stage 3: Runner
- Fresh Node 20 Alpine image (smaller)
- Creates non-root user for security
- Copies only:
  - Standalone server (`server.js`)
  - Static assets (`.next/static`)
  - Public files
- Runs as `nextjs` user (not root)
- Exposes port 3000
- Starts with `node server.js`

## Build Optimization

The standalone output bundles:
- Only production dependencies
- Minified JavaScript
- Optimized images
- No dev dependencies

**Result**: ~150MB final image vs ~800MB with full node_modules

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails with "Cannot find module"

**Cause**: Missing dependency in package.json

**Fix**:
```bash
npm install <missing-package>
git add package.json package-lock.json
railway up
```

### "Server is not ready" error

**Cause**: Environment variables not set at build time

**Fix**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables must be set **before** running `railway up`:
```bash
railway variables set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://...
railway up
```

### Port binding issues

**Cause**: Railway sets `PORT` environment variable

**Fix**: Already handled! Dockerfile sets:
```dockerfile
ENV PORT=3000
ENV HOSTNAME="0.0.0.0"
```

Next.js standalone server automatically uses these.

### Build timeout

**Cause**: Large dependencies or slow network

**Fix**: Railway has 10-minute timeout. If needed:
1. Remove unused dependencies
2. Use `npm ci` instead of `npm install` (already done)
3. Upgrade Railway plan for faster builds

## Railway vs Nixpacks Comparison

| Aspect | Nixpacks (Old) | Dockerfile (New) |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Monorepo Detection** | ‚ùå Always detected workspace | ‚úÖ Isolated build context |
| **Build Control** | Limited | Full control |
| **Cache Busting** | Difficult | Easy (`docker build --no-cache`) |
| **Build Size** | ~800MB | ~150MB |
| **Build Time** | 3-5 min | 2-3 min |
| **Debugging** | Opaque | Clear stages |

## Environment Variable Reference

### Required at Build Time
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` - Backend API endpoint
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - Frontend domain

### Required at Runtime
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to `production`
- `PORT` - Auto-set by Railway (3000 default)

### Optional
- `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` - Set to `1` (already in Dockerfile)

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Dockerfile exists in `apps/frontend/`
- [ ] next.config.ts has `output: 'standalone'`
- [ ] railway.toml configured with `builder = "DOCKERFILE"`
- [ ] Railway project linked (`railway link`)
- [ ] Environment variables set
- [ ] Run `railway up` from `apps/frontend/`
- [ ] Check logs: `railway logs`
- [ ] Verify URL works
- [ ] Test API connection
- [ ] Add custom domain (optional)

## Custom Domain Setup

After successful deployment:

```bash
railway domain add your-domain.com
```

Then add DNS records at your provider:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: @
Value: your-app.up.railway.app
```

SSL certificate is automatic via Let's Encrypt.

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Monitor logs**: `railway logs --follow`
2. **Set up alerts**: Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Notifications
3. **Add custom domain**: Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains
4. **Scale resources**: Settings ‚Üí Resources (if needed)
5. **Enable PR previews**: Settings ‚Üí Environments

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Build completes without errors
‚úÖ Deployment shows as "Active"
‚úÖ Health check passes
‚úÖ Homepage loads at Railway URL
‚úÖ No console errors in browser
‚úÖ API calls work (check Network tab)

## Rollback

If deployment fails:

```bash
# View deployments
railway deployments

# Rollback to previous
railway rollback <deployment-id>
```

---

**Ready to deploy!** Just run:

```bash
cd apps/frontend
railway link        # Interactive - select your project
railway up          # Deploy with Dockerfile
railway logs        # Monitor deployment
```

The custom Dockerfile approach gives you **full control** and eliminates all monorepo detection issues! üöÄ
